# FT-Sensors

On this page I share my hopefully growing list of designs to integrate common sensor boards for Arduino (and others) with the FT building block system. 

# FT Box Generic

Parametric template file to start designing custom boxes. Primarily important are the paramaters

* length in blocks (15mm)
* width in blocks (15mm)
* height in blocks (15mm)

which set the box size in FT size units. From there a top and bottom half part is generated which can then be modified to fit particular components. 

# FT Proximity Sensor

Case for common proximity sensors.
